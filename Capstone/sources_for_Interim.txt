===================== Regarding Right of Way ==========================

-> 50 feet for contractors working for CP

Page 20: right of way = 50 feet
Page 23-25: strict rule of 50 feet 






===================== Regarding speed of trains ======================

-> Canadian Rail Operating Rule

effective solution in most Canadian and North American jurisdiction"

FACTORS THAT SLOWDOWN EMERGENCY RESPONSE TIME
-> "In Saskatoon, there are tendencies to assume that blockages at level crossings contribute to
only a small percentage of emergency response delays, but in reality, trains delay first responders
on a weekly and daily basis."


-> "fire equipment allocation. In other special fire incidents, the Fire Department
respond with specific types of fire engines which are not located in all the fire districts.
examples include; engines,
ladders, tankers, brush, decontamination, rescue boats, etc."


-> "occurrence of multiple
incidents in a fire district which require pre-emptive reallocation of a fire engine."
