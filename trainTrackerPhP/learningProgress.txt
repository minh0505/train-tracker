<< FUNDAMENTAL >>

HTML is for taging document.  This is a paragraph, this is a title, this is a
link, etc...,, Then you ad all the pretty pictures and colors with CSS.

PHP is a server side programming  language that is primary used in web
applications.

Go to amazon.com everything you see is HTML and CSS.
Everything the site does, like remember you, store stuff in your shopping cart,
process your one click order, etc... This is all PHP, ruby, Python and whatever
else Amazon wants to use.

As far as learning, you can learn HTML in a few hours along with Css. You won't
be able to make anything good- that comes with practice- but, you will
understand WTF is going on. Now PHP,  that is a full blown programming
language that is often used to talk to DATABASES, so you have to learn a little
SQL also. This will take you days if not weeks to wrap your head around.

Now, most people are going to tell you all sorts of crazy stuff about PHP and
how it relates to HTML and the rest of the Internet. Most of those people are
idiots!  if you don't understand data structure, loops, variables, functions,
databases, so injects etc...  You don't know PHP.  You might know some cool
party tricks, maybe impress your friends, which is cool.

If your talking about really getting into this game of web applications and
beyond?

this is the recipe for success in this order

1. HTML
2. CSS
3. JavaScript - this is a full blown programming language also! So buy a book,
something with a title like JAvaScript Programming. One you learn key
programming concepts you can learn the syntax of any language and be
considerable effective
4. PHP - it's probably the second most used and popular programming language in
the world. The first is, you guessed it, JavaScript.
5. SQL - this is for working with databases.

-> HTML and CSS presentation
-> Everything else -functionality




There are two types of scripting languages : client side scripting and server
side scripting languages.
- Javascript, VBscript, etc are client side scripting languages. If you write
code in these, the code is downloaded on client's computer and executed there.
- PHP, ASP etc are server side scripting languages, they execute on the server
and only the output is downloaded on the client's computer.
